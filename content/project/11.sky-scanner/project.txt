The Sky Scanner was developed for the accountant and entrepreneur Amar Latif who has been
blind for much of his adult life. 
Amar described a situation in which others would comment on the sky by saying “Nice day
isn’t it?” while often he himself was oblivious to the visible aspects of weather due to
his visual impairment.
We created a simple device that communicates the nuances of different weather conditions
through musical patterns and explores the mood that different sounds can convey. 
Our intention is to replace lost visual information with audio information that can be
obtained independently by Amar, providing him with knowledge he can apply both practically
and socially.
