 Random Recipes is a discreet product designed for busy families in busy cities. It
generates a random ingredients list for the user every morning. Then generates the
corresponding method for the ingredients when the user comes home. This takes control away
from the them, but also gives them a healthy, tasty meal every night without them having
to think too much. When you get the recipe list in the morning, it is unclear what you
will be making, until you get the method in the evening, adding risk and a surprise. We
chose to incorporate this playfulness into the design of the product.
