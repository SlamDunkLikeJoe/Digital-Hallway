Cash flow is a water feature designed to fit into your daily routine.  A simple glance on
the way out the door gives the user an abstract view of their financial state based on
their bank balance, which may affect how they spend their day.  It’s aim is to give the
user a simple way to gauge their finances, while maintaining a level of privacy. What is
considered to be a large amount of money and a little amount of money is decided by the
user and is represented by the speed of the water, so your finances stay personal while
acting as a decorative focal point in the home.
