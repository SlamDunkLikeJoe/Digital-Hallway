Our concept is a reinterpretation of the barometer, making it more accessible for visually
impaired people, who would be interested in a similar interaction with a device to be able
to tell what the weather may be like: emphasis on the word may! The device instead of
giving you exact weather predictions, is more based on the ancient rhyme "red sky at
night, shepherds delight, red sky in the morning, shepherds warning.". Similar to seeing
this out of a window, the chosen interaction would be much like opening blinds in order to
inspect the morning or evening sky.
