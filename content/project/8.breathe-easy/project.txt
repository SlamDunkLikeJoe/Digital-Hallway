Our concept is a wall mounted display that makes the user more aware of the air quality in
certain locations. The device takes the information from Twitter. As the information
changes, the lights will change the speed they pulse depending on the quality of the air.
The different speeds of the pulse represents breathing. The better the quality of the air,
the slower the light pulse will be. This represents slow and calm deep breaths. If the air
quality is poor the pulses of the lights will be short and sharp. We hope the device will
provoke family discussion as to what each level of light pulse means.
