Twittering is a web enabled telephone that allows people with estranged family members to
gain an ambient sense of activity among their loved ones.
Knowing that a person is active and well can be extremely comforting, so much so that we
don't need to contact them directly. We gathered Twitter activity and made this with
people who don't regularly use social media in mind.
When Twittering rings, we're being spoken to; if it moves, someone said something; if
there's a lot of chatter on the line, everyone's been busy today. Everyone knows how to
use a telephone and everyone wants to hear from their loved ones. This phone is an easy
and fun way of twittering.
