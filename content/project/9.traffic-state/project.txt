Traffic State is a device that we designed to represent traffic movement within New York
in a visual way. Its aim is to aid the user's decision in the morning as to what form of
transport they should take. The position of the metal parabola hanging below the allows the user to gauge the
traffic over the past two and a half hours. The Traffic State is designed to be read like
a graph. It allows us to read the state of the traffic at present and the user will be
able to become familiar with it over time.Â
