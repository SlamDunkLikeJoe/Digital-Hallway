This device encourages sustainable living to home users. It informs the user how much
energy their home is currently using in comparison with their local community and the
Nation.
The idea is to encourage home owners to switch off appliances and reduce their energy
consumption.
The device is activated by pressing the button. Once activated the boxes light up
depending on the energy use in the areas. Green represents lowest energy use and red
represents the highest.
Our project aim was to encourage users to reduce their energy bills, to maintain a green
light for the box that represents their home.
