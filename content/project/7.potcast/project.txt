The PotCast allows city kids to connect with and learn about nature. The plant is located
in the hallway of the home so the child can interact with it as part of their morning
routine. When the plant is watered, the PotCast plays a podcast which is broadcasted
weekly and aimed at kids interested in ecology. In between releases a light display on the
PotCast represents the moisture levels and acts as a countdown. When the plant hasnâ€™t been
watered for a week the display indicates that the plant is thirsty and there is a new
podcast to listen to.
