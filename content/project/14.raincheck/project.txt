RainCheck is a 21st century adaptation of a barometer. It uses live data from an online
weather forecast and translates it into a tactile experience for the user. Our project is
inspired by a person checking the weather by putting their hand out of a window. RainCheck
provides a similarly tactile but more accurate way of forecasting the weather. On opening,
the device recreates the level of rain expected that day - light, medium or heavy - using
artificially created raindrops. This interaction could take place in the hall before the
user leaves the house, allowing them to make an informed decision on choice of clothing or
activity.
