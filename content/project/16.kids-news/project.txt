Our concept was designed with children in mind. The device delivers the day’s main news
article on a printed slip when a button is pushed. This device takes info from the CBBC
Newsround website and formats it into a rich, bite sized digest. The product aims to
inform children of current affairs and hopefully spark an interest in this subject from a
young age, and to help parents interact with their children by giving them a shared
interest in the news. We hope this mixture of simple interaction and clear useful
information will have a positive effect on today’s youth.
