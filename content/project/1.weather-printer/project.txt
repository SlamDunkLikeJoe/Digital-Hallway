Our concept makes use of an Arduino and a thermal printer that prints out New York Weather
information at Sunrise and Sunset. We designed our prototype around a busy New York City
parent so just before they leave their home for work they will have a printed tweet
waiting for them. We have sourced our data from a website called ifttt.com that then
tweets to our Twitter account @1NYCWeather. We made use of an ethernet shield attached to
our Arduino to retrieve data from Twitter. This is all connected to the printer that
automatically prints two tweets per day.
