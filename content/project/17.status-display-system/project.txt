Our device, SDS, shows the user what the tube service is like on the circle and district
lines on the London Underground. The dial moves 180 degrees in correspondence to how good
or bad the service is at that time by taking information straight from the internet. The
information is updated every minute, this does not mean the information or dial will
change every minute but gives the user an accurate reading. This device would be placed in
the hall of the user's home so they can quickly glance to see how good the service is and
make a decision on how they are going to travel that morning.
