Our concept is a map which shows the different bus routes and stations around the area our
client lives and works. This map streams data from an online API which tracks the buses as
they arrive and leave the stations by lighting LEDs. On our prototype we have focused on
the different parts of his journey; the past, present and future. The first set of icons
concentrate on the past and show pictures of what he has time for if the particular bus is
around that station. The later icons are landmarks which give him a mental picture of
where he is and how far away he is from his destination.
