Touchwood is a single functional information device designed to deliver key information
for the day ahead. The device would be placed near the front door so it could be easily
accessed by the user as they leave their home. Design for the disabled is an area that we
all became fascinated with after our visit from Amar Latif (a visually impaired
individual), due to this our design is aimed at the visually impaired. Touchwood delivers
its information by playing a D major scale as you run your hand along the top face of the
device. Each coat peg will deliver a corresponding note; the higher the pitch the more
appropriate the jacket. The device functions by taking a feed from the internet and then
splitting it into three data fields: wind speed, feels like temperature, and current
conditions. Having all three of these variables allows for a wide range of conditions and
many weather combinations.
