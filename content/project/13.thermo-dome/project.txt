We have seamlessly fitted the temperature of the user's destination into their life.
Keeping with the barometer's traditional functions we want to effect people’s life from
how they are presented an aspect of the weather, in our project…the temperature. 

Inspired by Amar’s morning search for the temperature by placing his hand out of the
window, we want to keep this familiar gesture and interaction but update it, making it
much more beneficial and effective. 

Using this before leaving the door in the morning the user will fell and experience
today’s temperature at their fingertips, giving them an accurate idea of what garment to
select before leaving.
