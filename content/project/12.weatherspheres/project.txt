Consisting of rain, wind and temperature, the WeatherSpheres takes data from the internet
and recreates it in a non visual way. Each sphere has its own unique material allowing the
visually impaired to tell the difference by touching each one before picking it up and
activating it. Once picked up and turned over the WeatherSpheres activate and represent
their weather type using multiple senses. So not only do they get the weather forecast but
they also leave the house each day with a pleasant experience.
