#Come and experience our Digital Hallway

Level three Social Digital, a combination of
Digital Interaction Design and Product Design students from the University of Dundee, are
hosting an exhibition to showcase a range of objects which communicate live data through
physical interactions. Our inspiration came from two different sources: the needs of
visually impaired people and research about family life in busy cities. 

The projects will be available to view all day on the 17th of January 2013 with a drinks 
reception from 5-9pm in the Matthew Building level 7 Product Design studios. 

#Thanks
There were many people involved in the creation of this project and weâ€™d like to thank them for all their help.
